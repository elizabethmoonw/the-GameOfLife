# The Game of Life
Conway’s “Game” of Life is not actually a game that one plays; rather it is a simulation from some initial state following a set of rules. The state of the game is a grid (matrix) of elements, sometimes called cells. A cell can be either alive or dead. In one step of the game, the cells will either live or die according to some rules. Three functions are written to simulate this game. The rules stated below are taken from the Wikipedia entry on Conway’s Game of Life.
